The next queue is the vehicles.  We have all the same caveats for vehicles as we do for infantry - the replay format doesn't tell us whether the unit is produced, only whether it is added to the queue.  Disclaimers out of the way, the raw numbers for each season look like this:

Unsurprisingly the most queued vehicles are heavy tanks and mediums.  In earlier seasons then artilleries top the table, which ties in with the greater popularity of radar play and Allies.  I've heard from several sources that arti spam used to be the standard strategy in older seasons (although interestingly it only has a 49% S01 win rate compared with 58% for medium tanks).

The next graph takes the number of each unit queued and divides it by the number of times it was possible to queue it.  There are twenty different vehicles (ignoring minor differences like the two types of minelayer) which is really too much for one graph, so I've tried to highlight the top four in colour.

After heavies we can see that flak tracks are the most popular unit for Soviet players. Given they're a common light vehicle pre-service depot and they're also useful post radar dome for harassing artilleries and anti-air then this is unsurprising.

In the next post then we'll have a look at medium tanks vs heavy tanks a bit more.
