Topping the list every season are Power Plants, Refs and Barracks. These are the first buildings placed and each player needs several to get infantry production up to full speed. Barracks and PPs are also useful for base pushes.  Note that there are minor discrepancies in the number of builds containing each of these buildings which is due to games that were abandoned at the start, but uploaded to Jazz's archive anyway.

The fourth spot has historically gone to the Advanced Power Plant, but in S09 there was a huge drop in popularity.  Perhaps surprisingly the Radar Dome is consistently seen in about 15-20% more builds than the Advanced Power Plant. Possibly players continue to use the standard PP, or perhaps because building a Radar Dome is often done near the end of the game.

Tech buildings have had a noticeable change in popularity. Service Depot builds have crept from 90% of all builds in Season 1 to 96% in Season 9. Meanwhile radar domes have had a dramatic fall from grace. In Season 1 they were part of the standard build, whereas in Season 9 many games end without one.  The Tech Centre has hovered around the 30% mark, but in Season 9 they hit an all time low of 20%.

Conversely, looking at the win rates for these three buildings, we can see that the Service Depot and Radar Dome are basically at 50% win and loss (due to their pervasiveness).  Tech Centres correlate with winning the game - although as always it's hard to identify cause and effect.

Finally I thought it was worth having a look at Naval.  Naval Yards and Sub Pens were seen in about 3-4% of builds in Seasons 1 and 2, but for Seasons 5, 6 and 7 they weren't seen at all.  I didn't check, but I expect this is predominantly due to the maps not having suitable spots. Season 9 featured two maps supporting naval play, and still only Mo attempted to make use of it.  Hopefully by Season 10 we'll have naval balance sorted out ;-)
