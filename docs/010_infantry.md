We've covered the buildings queue, so next let's look at the infantry queue.  The replay files make it very easy to see when buildings are built - the player performs an action to place them.  However for units then it's much harder. The player simply queues the unit, and then the game engine determines when (and if) it will be built, based on questions such as:
 * Does the player have enough credits?
 * Is the player on low power?
 * How many production facilities are there?
 * Are the prerequisite buildings still there?
 * Did the game already end?

Given that, here are the number of each that were queued (not built), the number of builds they appeared in (and what percentage of all the games that was), and the win rate of players who built at least one of the unit.

```

The first thing that stands out in these numbers is how many more rifles and rockets are queued than anything else. In the games I looked at then there were 883615 rifles and 292896 rockets queued. That makes an average ratio of almost exactly 3 rifles to every rocket.

The next thing I thought was interesting was the third placed unit. Over the seasons this has changed - S01 Shockie, S02-04 Medic, S05-07 Shockie, S08-09 Flamer.  Partly this is due to how popular Allies and Soviets were each season.

At the bottom of the list there are the thief and spy (and Tanya in S08). These are precision units that it doesn't make sense to spam.
