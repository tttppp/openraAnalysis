One thing that immediately stands out is that Pillboxes and Flame Towers are how people are filling their queues.  Seasons 1 and 2 have a very high number of Camo Pillboxes too, but from Season 3 onwards then the meta becomes Pillboxes for Allies and Flame Towers with a sprinkling of Teslacoils for Soviets.

Some of these stats are a little hard to compare, since Allies and Soviets weren't picked evenly, so next I wanted to look at how often the main ground defences appear in Allied/Soviet builds:

![Defence build rates](005_DefenceBuildRates.png)

This graph says that e.g. at least one pillbox was built by ~94% of Allied players in Season 9.  I think this graph shows the impact of the Tesla nerf in S09, with a noticeable number of Soviet players forgoing Teslacoils completely.  It also highlights the decline of the Camo Pillbox, and shows that even in Seasons 1 and 2, when they were the second most popular defence, they were only built by a relatively small number of players.  This brings us nicely onto the topic of spamming.

It's often been mentioned that Pillbox spam used to be all the rage and to investigate this I calculated the average number of each defence *placed* (not queued as in the data above) per player that was the right faction.  So for example this is the total Pillboxes placed divided by the number of times Allies was played, but the total number of Missile Silos is divided by the total players, regardless of faction.  For Concrete Walls ("==") and Sandbag/Fences ("--") I've just counted each click as one placement, although it may cause several tiles to be filled.

![Average Defence Count](005_DefenceAvgCount.png)

So Pillbox spam was at its worst in Season 5, with an average of 9.5 Pillboxes placed each game per Allied player!  We can also see that the diversity of defences has dropped, possibly due to players learning the relative values of different defences, but possibly due to changes in balance.  One obvious example is that AA Gun usage dropped pretty much in line with Radar Domes.  The bottom of the graph is quite hard to read, so here's the same data on a logarithmic scale:

![Logarithmic graph of average defence count](005_DefenceAvgCountLog.png)

We can group the defences by popularity (or "spammability"). The top six (Pillbox, Flame Tower, Tesla Coil, Turret, Camo Pillbox, AA Gun) are all built an average of once every 3 builds or more. Below that we have SAM Site, Iron Curtain and Concrete Walls, which are rare, but certainly not unseen. Next we have the other tech defences - Missile Silo, Chronosphere, Gap Generator and Sandbags/Fences. Finally we have the Silo (which wasn't actually built in Season 7 - there's a mistake in the graph due to the log-scaling).

We can see that SAM Sites are much less popular than AA Guns, due in part to being less performant, but also because Soviets are able to make better use of Flaks.

One final observation here - the Iron Curtain is vastly more popular than the Chronosphere or Missile Silo.  For example in S09 then Chonospheres were built once for every 100 (Allied) players, Missile Silos once for every 67 players and Iron Curtains once for every 7 (Soviet) players.
