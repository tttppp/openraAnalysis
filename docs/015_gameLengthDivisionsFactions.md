I had a few more thoughts about factors affecting game lengths.  First I noticed that the list of the longest matches had a bias towards Masters games.  I calculated the average game length for matches that specified which division they were from in the filename:

Overall it's possible that Masters games last slightly longer on average, but it's certainly not a consistent trend.

The other thing I wondered about was the notion of stalematey Allies mirror matches. I found the average game lengths for Allies and Soviet mirror matches, and I split the other games into those where Allies won and those where Soviets won:

I was quite surprised by this - it seems like in recent times then Soviet matches have lasted slightly longer on average.  This was backed up by the list of the longest matches - for each I looked up the factions involved and found that there were actually no Allies mirror matches at all.
